# HELP TEACHER

University project for end of course in mobile application development class


  
### Description  

Many people have learning struggles and difficulties with certain subjects. At the same time, teachers, instructors and beginners want to pass on their knowledge.  

However, the lack of opportunity makes this interaction difficult, whether on the part of students with inferior financial conditions, teachers without opportunities in the market, or instructors trying to get the opportunity to transmit their knowledge.  

**Help Teacher** arrives to link these two profiles, facilitating communication and contracting services. In an autonomous and entrepreneurial way, teachers can build up their student base and at the same time students can gain new experiences.
